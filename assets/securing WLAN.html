<p>Almost as soon as notebook computers appeared, many people had a dream of walking into an office and magically having their notebook computer be connected to the Internet. </p>
<p>Consequently, various groups began working on ways to accomplish this goal. The most practical approach is to equip both the office and the notebook computers with short-range radio transmitters and receivers to allow them to communicate.</p>
<p> This work rapidly led to wireless LANs being marketed by a variety of companies.</p>

	<p>The second problem that had to be solved is that a radio signal can be reflected off solid objects, so it may be received multiple times (along multiple paths). </p>
	<p>This interference results in what is called multipath fading.</p>
 <p>The third problem is that a great deal of software is not aware of mobility. For example, many word processors have a list of printers that users can choose from to print a file.</p>
 <p>When the computer on which the word processor runs is taken into a new environment, the built-in list of printers becomes invalid.</p>

<p>First, a computer on Ethernet always listens to the ether before transmitting. Only if the ether is idle does the computer begin transmitting. </p>
<p>With wireless LANs, that idea does not work so well.</p>
<p>Suppose that computer A is transmitting to computer B, but the radio range of A's transmitter is too short to reach computer C. </p>
<p>If C wants to transmit to B it can listen to the ether before starting, but the fact that it does not hear anything does not mean that its transmission will succeed. The 802.11 standard had to solve this problem.</p>
