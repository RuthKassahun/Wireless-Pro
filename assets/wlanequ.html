<p>The rapid worldwide growth in cellular telephone subscribers has demonstrated conclusively that wireless communications is a robust, viable voice and data transport mechanism. </p>
<p>The widespread success of cellular has led to the development of newer wireless systems and standards for many other types of telecommunication traffic besides mobile voice telephone calls. </p>
<p>For example, next generation cellular networks are being designed to facilitate high speed data communications traffic in addition to voice calls. </p>
<p>New standards and technologies are being implemented to allow wireless networks to replace fiber optic or copper lines between fixed points several kilometers apart (fixed wireless access). </p>

<p>Similarly, wireless networks have been increasingly used as a replacement for wires within homes, buildings, and office settings through the deployment of wireless local area networks (WLANs). </p>
<p>The evolving Bluetooth modem standard promises to replace troublesome appliance communication cords with invisible wireless connections within a person's personal workspace.</p>

	<p>Used primarily within buildings, WLANs and Bluetooth use low power levels and generally do not require a license for spectrum use. </p>
<p>These license-free networks provide an interesting dichotomy in the wireless market, since ad-hoc high data rate networks are being deployed by individuals within buildings without a license, whereas wireless carriers who own the spectrum licenses for mobile cellular telephone service have focused on providing outdoor voice coverage and have been slow to provide reliable in-building coverage and high data rate services to their cellular subscribers.</a> 
<a>While it is still too early to tell, it appears that the in-building wireless access market may become a huge battleground between licensed and unlicensed services.
