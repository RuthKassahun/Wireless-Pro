<p>IETF has known for years that security was lacking in the Internet. Adding it was not easy because a war broke out about where to put it. Most security experts believe that to be really secure, encryption and integrity checks have to be end to end (i.e., in the application layer). </p>
<p>That is, the source process encrypts and/or integrity protects the data and sends that to the destination process where it is decrypted and/or verified. Any tampering done in between these two processes, including within either operating system, can then be detected. 
works to replace fiber optic or copper lines between fixed points several kilometers apart (fixed wireless access). </p>

	<p>The trouble with this approach is that it requires changing all the applications to make them security aware. In this view, the next best approach is putting encryption in the transport layer or in a new layer between the application layer and the transport layer, making it still end to end but not requiring applications to be changed.

	<p>The major services are secrecy, data integrity, and protection from replay attacks (intruder replays a conversation). All of these are based on symmetric-key cryptography because high performance is crucial.
The reason for having multiple algorithms is that an algorithm that is now thought to be secure may be broken in the future. By making IPsec algorithm-independent, the framework can survive even if some particular algorithm is later broken.
