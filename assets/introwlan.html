<p>System interconnection is all about interconnecting the components of a computer using short-range radio.</p>
 <p>Almost every computer has a monitor, keyboard, mouse, and printer connected to the main unit by cables. </p>
<p>So many new users have a hard time plugging all the cables into the right little holes (even though they are usually color coded) 
that most computer vendors offer the option of sending a technician to the user's home to do it. Consequently, 
<p>some companies got together to design a short-range wireless network called Bluetooth to connect these components without wires. </p>

Bluetooth also allows digital cameras, headsets, scanners, and other devices to connect to a computer by merely being brought within range. No cables, no driver installation, just put them down, turn them on, and they work. For many people, this ease of operation is a big plus.
In the simplest form, system interconnection networks use the master-slave paradigm of Fig. 4-5(a). The system unit is normally the master, talking to the mouse, keyboard, etc., as slaves. The master tells the slaves what addresses to use, when they can broadcast, how long they can transmit, what frequencies they can use, and so on.

	The next step up in wireless networking are the wireless LANs. These are systems in which every computer has a radio modem and antenna with which it can communicate with other systems. 
Often there is an antenna on the ceiling that the machines talk to, as shown in Fig. 4.5(b). However, if the systems are close enough, they can communicate directly with one another in a peer-to-peer configuration. 
Wireless LANs are becoming increasingly common in small offices and homes, where installing Ethernet is considered too much trouble, as well as in older office buildings, company cafeterias, conference rooms, and other places. 
There is a standard for wireless LANs, called IEEE 802.11, which most systems implement and which is becoming very widespread.
