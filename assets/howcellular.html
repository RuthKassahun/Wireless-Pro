When a cellular phone is turned on, but is not yet engaged in a call, it first scans the group of forward control channels to determine the one with the strongest signal, and then monitors that control channel until the signal drops below a usable level. 
At this point, it again scans the control channels in search of the strongest base station signal.

	The mobile switching center is sometimes called a mobile telephone switching office (MTSO), since it is responsible for connecting all mobiles to the PSTN in a cellular system. 
Each mobile communicates via radio with one of the base stations and may be handed-off to any number of base stations throughout the duration of a call. 
The mobile station contains a transceiver, an antenna, and control circuitry, and may be mounted in a vehicle or used as a portable hand-held unit. 
The base stations consist of several transmitters and receivers which simultaneously handle full duplex communications and generally have towers which support several transmitting and receiving antennas.

	When a telephone call is placed to a mobile user, the MSC dispatches the request to all base stations in the cellular system. 
The mobile identification number (MIN), which is the subscriber's telephone number, is then broadcast as a paging message over all of the forward control channels throughout the cellular system. 
The mobile receives the paging message sent by the base station which it monitors, and responds by identifying itself over the reverse control channel. The base station relays the acknowledgment sent by the mobile and informs the MSC of the handshake.

		Then, the MSC instructs the base station to move the call to an unused voice channel within the cell (typically, between ten to sixty voice channels and just one control channel are used in each cell's base station). 
At this point, the base station signals the mobile to change frequencies to an unused forward and reverse voice channel pair, at which point another data message (called an alert) is transmitted over the forward voice channel to instruct the mobile telephone to ring, thereby instructing the mobile user to answer the phone
