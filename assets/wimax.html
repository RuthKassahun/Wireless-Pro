<p>Almost as soon as notebook computers appeared, many people had a dream of walking into an office and magically having their notebook computer be connected to the Internet. </p>
<p>Consequently, various groups began working on ways to accomplish this goal. The most practical approach is to equip both the office and the notebook computers with short-range radio transmitters and receivers to allow them to communicate. This work rapidly led to wireless LANs being marketed by a variety of companies.</p>

<p>The trouble was that no two of them were compatible. This proliferation of standards meant that a computer equipped with a brand X radio would not work in a room equipped with a brand Y base station. </p>
<p>Finally, the industry decided that a wireless LAN standard might be a good idea, so the IEEE committee that standardized the wired LANs was given the task of drawing up a wireless LAN standard. The standard it came up with was named 802.11. </p>
<p>A common slang name for it is WiFi. It is an important standard and deserves respect, so we will call it by its proper name, 802.11.</p>

	The proposed standard had to work in two modes:
	<ul>
<li>In the presence of a base station.</li>
<li>In the absence of a base station.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the former case, all communication was to go through the base station, called an access point in 802.11 terminology. </p>
<p>In the latter case, the computers would just send to one another directly. This mode is now sometimes called ad hoc networking. </p><p>A typical example is two or more people sitting down together in a room not equipped with a wireless LAN and having their computers just communicate directly.
To make matters even more complicated than they already were, the 802 committee has come up with yet another variant, 802.11g, which uses the modulation technique of 802.11a but the frequency band of 802.11b.</p>
<p>That 802.11 is going to cause a revolution in computing and Internet access is now beyond any doubt. Airports, train stations, hotels, shopping malls, and universities are rapidly installing it.</p>
<p>Even upscale coffee shops are installing 802.11 so that the assembled yuppies can surf the Web while drinking their lattes. It is likely that 802.11 will do to the Internet what notebook computers did to computing: make it mobile.</p>

		Then, the MSC instructs the base station to move the call to an unused voice channel within the cell (typically, between ten to sixty voice channels and just one control channel are used in each cell's base station). 
At this point, the base station signals the mobile to change frequencies to an unused forward and reverse voice channel pair, at which point another data message (called an alert) is transmitted over the forward voice channel to instruct the mobile telephone to ring, thereby instructing the mobile user to answer the phone
