	<p>Paging systems are communication systems that send brief messages to a subscriber. </p>
	 <p>Depending on the type of service, the message may be either</p>
	 <ul>
	 <li> a numeric message</li> 
	 <li>an alphanumeric message</li> 
	 <li> a voice message. </li>
	 </ul>
<p>Paging systems are typically used to notify a subscriber of the need to call a particular telephone number or travel to a known location to receive further instructions.</p>
<p>In modern paging systems, news headlines, stock quotations, and faxes may be sent. </p>
<p>A message is sent to a paging subscriber via the paging system access number (usually a toll-free telephone number) with a telephone keypad or modem.</p>
<p> The issued message is called a page. The paging system then transmits the page throughout the service area using base stations which broadcast the page on a radio carrier.</p>

		Paging systems vary widely in their complexity and coverage area. While simple paging systems may cover a limited range of 2 to 5 km, or may even be confined to within individual buildings, wide area paging systems can provide worldwide coverage. 
Though paging receivers are simple and inexpensive, the transmission system required is quite sophisticated. 
Wide area paging systems consist of a network of telephone lines, many base station transmitters, and large radio towers that simultaneously broadcast a page from each base station (this is called simulcasting). 
Simulcast transmitters may be located within the same service area or in different cities or countries

		Paging systems are designed to provide reliable communication to subscribers wherever they are inside a building, driving on a highway, or flying in an airplane. 
This necessitates large transmitter powers (on the order of kilowatts) and low data rates (a couple of thousand bits per second) for maximum coverage from each base station.
