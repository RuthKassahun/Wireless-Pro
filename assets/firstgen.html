The rapid worldwide growth in cellular telephone subscribers has demonstrated conclusively that wireless communications is a robust, viable voice and data transport mechanism. 
The widespread success of cellular has led to the development of newer wireless systems and standards for many other types of telecommunication traffic besides mobile voice telephone calls.
For example, next generation cellular networks are being designed to facilitate high speed data communications traffic in addition to voice calls. New standards and technologies are being implemented to allow wireless networks to replace fiber optic or copper lines between fixed points several kilometers apart (fixed wireless access).

Second Generation (2G) Cellular Networks
Most of today's ubiquitous cellular networks use what is commonly called second generation or 2G technologies which conform to the second generation cellular standards. 
Unlike first generation cellular systems that relied exclusively on FDMA/FDD and analog FM, second generation standards use digital modulation formats and TDMA/FDD and CDMA/FDD multiple access techniques.
The most popular second generation standards include three TDMA standards and one CDMA standard:

	(a) Global System Mobile (GSM), which supports eight time slotted users for each 200 kHz radio channel and has been deployed widely in the cellular and PCS bands by service providers in Europe, Asia, Australia, South America, and some parts of the US (in the PCS spectrum band only).
(b) Interim Standard 136 (IS-I36), also known as North American Digital Cellular (NADC) or US Digital Cellular (USDC), which supports three time slotted users for each 30kHz radio channel and is a popular choice for carriers in North America, South America, and Australia (in both the cellular and PCS bands).

		(c) Pacific Digital Cellular (PDC), a Japanese TDMA standard that is similar to IS-136 with more than 50 million users; and
(d) the popular 2G CDMA standard Interim Standard 95 Code Division Multiple Access (IS-95), also known as cdmaOne, which supports up to 64 users that are orthogonally coded and simultaneously transmitted on each 1.25 MHz channel. CDMA is widely deployed by carriers in North America (in both cellular and PCS bands), as well as in Korea, Japan, China, South America, and Australia.
