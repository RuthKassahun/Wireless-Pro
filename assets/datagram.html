Paging systems vary widely in their complexity and coverage area. While simple paging systems may cover a limited range of 2 to 5 km, or may even be confined to within individual buildings, wide area paging systems can provide worldwide coverage. 
Though paging receivers are simple and inexpensive, the transmission system required is quite sophisticated. 
Wide area paging systems consist of a network of telephone lines, many base station transmitters, and large radio towers that simultaneously broadcast a page from each base station (this is called simulcasting). 
Simulcast transmitters may be located within the same service area or in different cities or countries.

	Cordless telephone systems are full duplex communication systems that use radio to connect a portable handset to a dedicated base station, which is then connected to a dedicated telephone line with a specific telephone number on the public switched telephone network (PSTN). 
In first generation cordless telephone systems (manufactured in the 1980s), the portable unit communicates only to the dedicated base unit and only over distances of a few tens of meters. Early cordless telephones operate solely as extension telephones to a transceiver connected to a subscriber line on the PS1N and are primarily for in-home use.

	The base station serves as a bridge between all mobile users in the cell and connects the simultaneous mobile calls via telephone lines or microwave links to the MSC. 
The MSC coordinates the activities of all of the base stations and connects the entire cellular system to the PSTN. A typical MSC handles 100,000 cellular subscribers and 5,000 simultaneous conversations at a time, and accommodates all billing and system maintenance functions, as well. In large cities, several MSCs are used by a single carrier.
