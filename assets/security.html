<p>It is surprisingly easy to design a system that is logically completely secure by using VPNs and firewalls, but that, in practice, leaks like a sieve. This situation can occur if some of the machines are wireless and use radio communication, which passes right over the firewall in both directions.</p>
 <p>The range of 802.11 networks is often a few hundred meters, so anyone who wants to spy on a company can simply drive into the employee parking lot in the morning, leave an 802.11-enabled notebook computer in the car to record everything it hears, and take off for the day. By late afternoon, the hard disk will be full of valuable goodies. </p>
 <p>Theoretically, this leakage is not supposed to happen. Theoretically, people are not supposed to rob banks, either.</p>

	<p>Much of the security problem can be traced to the manufacturers of wireless base stations (access points) trying to make their products user friendly. Usually, if the user takes the device out of the box and plugs it into the electrical power socket, it begins operating immediately ”nearly always with no security at all, blurting secrets to everyone within radio range.</p>
 <p>If it is then plugged into an Ethernet, all the Ethernet traffic suddenly appears in the parking lot as well. Wireless is a snooper's dream come true: free data without having to do any work. It therefore goes without saying that security is even more important for wireless systems than for wired ones. In this section, we will look at some ways wireless networks handle security</p>

	<h1>802.11 Security</h1>
<p>The 802.11 standard prescribes a data link-level security protocol called WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy), which is designed to make the security of a wireless LAN as good as that of a wired LAN.</p>
<p> Since the default for wired LANs is no security at all, this goal is easy to achieve, and WEP achieves it, as we shall see.</p>
<p>When 802.11 security is enabled, each station has a secret key shared with the base station. </p>
<p>How the keys are distributed is not specified by the standard. </p>
<p>They could be preloaded by the manufacturer. They could be exchanged in advance over the wired network. Finally, either the base station or user machine could pick a random key and send it to the other one over the air encrypted with the other one's public key. Once established, keys generally remain stable for months or years.</p>
