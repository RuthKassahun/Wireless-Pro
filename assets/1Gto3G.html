<p>General Packet Radio Service is a packet-based data network, which is well suited for non-real time Internet usage, including the retrieval of email, faxes, and asymmetric web browsing, where the user downloads much more data than it uploads on the Internet. 
</p>Unlike HSCSD, which dedicates circuit switched channels to specific users, GPRS supports multi-user network sharing of individual radio channels and time slots. 
<p>Thus, GPRS can support many more users than HSCSD, but in a bursty manner. </p>

<p>Similar to the Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD) standard developed for the North American AMPS systems in the early 1990s,
 the GPRS standard provides a packet network on dedicated GSM or IS-136 radio channels. GPRS  retains the original modulation formats specified in the original 20 CDMA standards, 
 <p>but uses a completely redefined air interface in order to better handle packet data access. </p>
<p>GPRS subscriber units are automatically instructed to tune to dedicated GPRS radio channels and particular time slots for "always on" access to the network.

	<p>When all eight time slots of a GSM radio channel are dedicated to GPRS, an individual user is able to achieve as much as<h4 style="text-color=#00bfff;"> 171.2 kbps (eight time slots multiplied by 21.4 kbps of raw uncoded data throughput).</h4> </p>
<p>Applications are required to provide their own error correction schemes as part of the carried data payload in GPRS. As is the case for any packet network, the data throughput experienced by an individual GPRS user decreases substantially as more users attempt to use the network or as propagation conditions become poor for particular users.</p> 
Just as in the case of CDPD, implementation of GPRS merely requires the GSM operator to install new routers and Internet gateways at the base station, along with new software that redefines the base station air interface standard for GPRS channels and time slots-no new base station RF hardware is required.

		It is worth noting that GPRS was originally designed to provide a packet data access overlay solely for GSM networks, but at the request of North American IS-136 operators, GPRS was extended to include both TDMA standards. 
As of late 2001, GPRS has been installed in markets serving over 100 million subscribers, and is poised to be the most popular near-term packet data solution for 2G TDMA-based technologies. The dedicated peak 21.4 kbps per channel data rate specified by GPRS works well with both GSM and IS-136 and has successfully been implemented.
